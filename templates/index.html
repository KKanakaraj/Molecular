    <font face = "Times New Roman" size = "5">
    <p style="text-align:justify;"> Oxytocin is considered as both a hormone and a neuromodulator. Oxytocin is involved in multiple functions: childbirth, sex thrive, and social behavior. It is a nine amino acid peptide produced by the  paraventricular nucleus and supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus. The posterior lobe of the pituitary receives axonal projections from the hypothalamus and oxytocin is released by the neurohypophysis. In addition, oxytocin neurons originating from the PVN form projections with other parts of the brain such as the amygdala, the hippocampus, the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area.</p><br>
    </font>

    <h3>What triggers the release of oxytocin?</h3><br>
    <font face = "Times New Roman" size = "5">

    This neuropeptide is released in response to psychological, social and even physical stressors.
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
    Oxytocin inhibits neurons in the amygdala that connects to other brain regions associated with fear such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (MPC). One of the roles of oxytocin is to reduce the activation of ACC and MPC and thus reduces social anxiety.
    CD28 is the cyclic ADP ribose nuclease which is a glycoprotein localized at cellâ€™s surface and is know to control oxytocin release.<br>
    
    </p>
    </font>
    <h3> Production of oxytocin </h3><br>
    <font face = "Times New Roman" size = "5">

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
    Oxytocin is mainly synthesized in the PVN (paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus) and supraoptic nucleus (SON), stored in the Heering bodies and released into the systemic circulation from the posterior pituitary. ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity is high in the hypothalamus and in the posterior pituitary. The lack of CD38 results in the decrease of ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity and thus lower cADPR formation which leads to alterations in OXT secretion in the hypothalamus and the pituitary. When it is released the oxytocin mainly binds to its receptor but it also has a weak affinity for the vasopressin receptor. Oxytocin binds to an oxytocin receptor known as OXTR, which belongs to the G-protein coupled seven transmembrane receptor family.</p><br>
    </font>
    
	<h2>Histology</h3><br>

	<p style="text-align:justify;">
    
    <font face = "Times New Roman" size = "5">

	Oxytocin is released by the axon terminals of the neurohypophysis in so-called Herring bodies. On electron microscopy images, these are dilated areas in the terminal portion of axons with clusters of neurosecretory granules (containing oxytocin, antidiuretic hormone and neurophysins). Herring bodies often lie close to capillaries, which can be seen on the following image showing the axon terminals of the neurohypophysis.</p><br>

                There are evidence that OXTR methylation may be dynamically regulated by psychosocial stress exposure, and it is associated with high callous unemotional (CU) traits and differential activation of brain regions involved in social perception.In the OXTR gene are present CpG island that stretches from about 20 to 2350 bp downstream of the transcription start site. CpG islands are regions of genome with high CpG density, where C stands for cytosine and G for guanine. Some investigations of hepatoblastoma cell line shown that the methylation of the OXTR CpG island functionally suppresses transcription. It was also identified a region of the OXTR CpG island, termed MT2, which seems to be responsible for most DNA methylation-induced silencing of these constructs. Deletion of the MT2 region in the full-length construct led to a relative rescue of transcriptional activity of the methylated construct to 68%. Finally, it possible to conclude that regulation of OXTR is sensitive to methylation within the MT2 region of the CpG island, and points toward functional significance of this region.</p>

            There are evidence that OXTR promoter methylation is associated with CU traits in young males (9-16 years). Even if it is unclear whether the increased methylation levels related with high CU traits reflect cumulative environmental exposure and is causally related to disturbances of social behaviour, or whether OXTR methylation is a consequence or epiphenomenon of high CU traits caused by other factors.</p>

        <h3>Dopamine and behavior</h3>

            Dopamine is related to social behavior as it is involved in the reward-pathway. Indeed, dopamine is responsible for social motivation and guides individuals toward or away of achieving an outcome. High levels of dopamine produce a high level of activity and thus impulsive behaviors. On the contrary, low levels of dopamine lead to slow psychological activity.
        <h3>Dopamine disorders</h3>

        Dopamine disorders are mainly found in Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, anxiety, depression and psychosis. The causes of dopamine disorders can be due to drug abuse that modifies the thresholds required for dopamine cell activation. In addition the lack of proteins in the diet, in particular L-tyrosine which is used for dopamine metabolism. To treat these disorders, dopamine agonists are used as well as changing the diet.

        <p style="text-align:justify;">
Estrogen act via genomic or non-genomic cascades. When estradiol E2 binds to nuclear estrogen receptor ERÎ± and ERÎ², the receptor complex dimerizes and binds to estrogen response elements (ERE) promoting downstream gene expression reflects as the genomic pathways.</p> 
            
        <p style="text-align:justify;"> E2 can also promote the activation of rapid cascade via membrane bound receptors which involved MAPK activation and downstream targets such as ERK and CREB, representing so the non-genomic pathway. 
In particular increased the number of pERKâ€“ir cells in the BNST(bed nucleus of the stria terminalis) and MEA(medial amygdala) under short days but not long days and pERK cell counts in the BNST and MEA were positively correlated with aggressive behaviors.</p><br>

            <font face = "Times New Roman" size = "5">

        <p style="text-align:justify;">These rapid non genomic actions carried out by estrogens seems have important effects on behavior, with high dependence of environment.These behaviors are differently affected principally by three estrogen receptors (ERs), ERÎ±, ERÎ², and the G protein-coupled ER 1(GPER1)</p>
            
        <p style="text-align:justify;">Experiments on rodents, quail and songbirds show that environmental features such as photoperiod (day length), endocrine disruptors and phytoestrogens impact the pathways involving estradiol.</p>
        </font>
        <h3>Aggressivity</h3>
        <font face = "Times New Roman" size = "5">

        <p style="text-align:justify;">Rapid effects of estradiol on aggression was seen in rodents with winter like photoperiods and, through analyses on genes controlled by estrogen response elements (ERE) in the promoter region, it was seen that short day photoperiods inhibit estrogen-dependent transcription in neural networks controlling aggression. 
            
        <p style="text-align:justify;">It was principally evidenced that lacking ERÎ± lead to a reduced aggression, instead of lacking ERÃŸ which causes higher levels of aggression as compared to wild type mice. Photoperiod induce changes in nuclear estrogen receptors are not directly responsible for the effects of short days aggression but more closely linked to short-day induced decreases in circulating testosterone.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align:justify;">These effects of photoperiod are independent of changes in gonadal hormones, so the behaviourally active estrogens are probably synthesized in the brain.</p><br>
        </font>
        
        <h3>Sexual behavior associated with aggressivity:</h3>
        <font face = "Times New Roman" size = "5">

        <p style="text-align:justify;">Sexual behavior and aggression are highly associated. Estrogens have rapid effects on mating behaviors and several experiments on male rats and comet goldfish shown as estradiol administrations induce in only 15-30 minutes copulatory behavior; mice spend more time in proximity to a female (higher proximity score).</p> 
            
        <p style="text-align:justify;">Local estradiol synthesis, and/or conversion of testosterone to estradiol via aromatase activity are the pathway through which sexual behavior is mediated.</p>
            </font>
        
        <h3>Learning and memory:</h3>
        <font face = "Times New Roman" size = "5">

        <p style="text-align:justify;"> ERÎ± agonist but not ERÃŸ one, rapidly facilitate social recognition behavior in mice, suggesting a role of ERÎ± as mediator of rapid effects of estrogens on learning behavior. There are also evidences that ERÎ± mediate rapid effect of estrogen on hippocampal morphology, working at extracellular site could rapidly affect LTD, long term depression.</p>
          </font>
        <h3>Environmental factors: phytoestrogens and endocrine disruptors</h3>
        <font face = "Times New Roman" size = "5">

        <p style="text-align:justify;">Many plants produce estrogen-like composite and also many industrial chemicals have estrogen like properties. In particular, corncob bedding is becoming one of the most wide-spread sources of phytoestrogens. Phytoestrogens such as isoflavone can affect behaviors mediated by the rapid action of estrogens; in particular phytoestrogens may be acting as an ER antagonist to affect sexual behavior in rodents.</p>
            
        <p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, exposure to endocrine disruptor such as Bisphenol A (BPA), a major component of many plastics, was found to increase aggression in mice and rats. Its effects can be especially long lasting, because these compounds can induce long lasting changes in DNA methylation in the brain.</p>

Testosterone</h1>
    <font face = "Times New Roman" size = "5">
    	<img src="../static/images/testo_structure.png" width="550"> <br><br>
    	<p style="text-align:justify;"> Testosterone is a steroid hormone and is the primary sex hormone in males. It plays an important role in the development of male reproductive tissues and promotes secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass and the growth of body hair. Its biological effects are mediated through the androgen receptor, where binding of testosterone ultimately results in changes of gene expression. Testosterone also regulates sex drive (libido), fat distribution and the production of red blood cells and sperm in adults. This hormone was also found to be involved in social behaviors such as relationships, mating, but also aggression and criminality.</p>

    	<h3>Romantic relationships</h3>
    <font face = "Times New Roman" size = "5">
    	<img src="../static/images/romantic_relationship.jpg" width="550"> <br><br>
    	<p style="text-align:justify;"> Testosterone plays important roles in human romantic relationship dynamics. It promotes mate pursuit at various timescales and may increase the odds of entering in a relationship. Testosterone levels increase after exposure to potential mates, whereas investment in parenting and marriages predicts declines in testosterone. Elevated testosterone may predict reduced relationship satisfaction and commitment. Testosterone levels have been measured in females and males falling in love. They were increased in females and decreased in males compared to control groups. This difference in testosterone has been suggested to results in the temporary reduction of differences in behavior between the sexes.</p>
    </font>

    	<h3>Agression and criminality</h3>
    <font face = "Times New Roman" size = "5">
    	<img src="../static/images/criminality.jpg" width="550"> <br><br>
    	<p style="text-align:justify;"> It has been shown that testosterone facilitates aggression by modulating vasopressin receptors in the hypothalamus in testosterone treated animals. A recent study using a pharmacogenetic approach found that testosterone increased aggression in men and effects were enhanced for men having a polymorphism in the AR gene associated with increased AR efficiency. Thus, testosterone appears to promote human aggression through an AR-related mechanism. Furthermore, effects are mediated by subjective reward associated with aggression and it is thought that testosterone regulates this reward through dopaminergic pathways.</p>
