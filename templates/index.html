    <h1> Oxytocin</h1>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"> Oxytocin is considered as both a hormone and a neuromodulator.Oxytocin is involved in multiple functions: childbirth, sex thrive, and social behavior. It is a nine amino acid peptide that cannot cross the blood barrier and enter the central nervous system. Oxytocin is a hormone produced by the  paraventricular nucleus and supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus. The posterior lobe of the pituitary receives axonal projections from the hypothalamus and oxytocin is released by the neurohypophysis. In addition, oxytocin neurons originating from the PVN form projections with other parts of the brain such as the amygdala, the hippocampus, the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area.</p>

    <h3>What triggers the release of oxytocin?</h3>
    
    This neuropeptide is released in response to psychological, social and even physical stressors.
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
    Oxytocin inhibits neurons in the amygdala that connects to other brain regions associated with fear such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (MPC). One of the roles of oxytocin is to reduce the activation of ACC and MPC and thus reduces social anxiety.
    CD28 is the cyclic ADP ribose nuclease which is a glycoprotein localized at cell’s surface and is know to control oxytocin release.
    
    </p>
    
    <h3> Production of oxytocin </h3>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
    Oxytocin is mainly synthesized in the PVN (paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus) and supraoptic nucleus (SON), stored in the Heering bodies and released into the systemic circulation from the posterior pituitary. ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity is high in the hypothalamus and in the posterior pituitary. The lack of CD38 results in the decrease of ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity and thus lower cADPR formation which leads to alterations in OXT secretion in the hypothalamus and the pituitary. When it is released the oxytocin mainly binds to its receptor but it also has a weak affinity for the vasopressin receptor. Oxytocin binds to an oxytocin receptor known as OXTR, which belongs to the G-protein coupled seven transmembrane receptor family.</p>

    <h3>Ethology</h3>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
    Oxytocin was shown to be involved in many psychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, mood and anxiety disorders. We here present the etiology for those oxytocin disorders based on a review of oxytocin's role in psychiatric disorders.</p>
	
	<h5><b>Autism</b></h5>

	<p style="text-align:justify;">
	Oxytocin has been demonstrated to have a role in social recognition, attachment and stereotyped behaviors in mouse models. As these correlate with deficits in ASD it has led to the research of oxytocin’s role in ASD pathophysiology (and potential therapeutic target). Lower plasma oxytocin levels in children with autism correlated to increased peptide inactive forms of oxytocin derived from the same prohormone, so ASD in children might come from a defect in peptide processing. However, studies in adults show conflicting results regarding oxytocin plasma levels. Genetically, specific alleles or SNPs in the oxytocin gene and OXTR were associated with ASD, but there is lack of consistency among different studies, each finding associations in different regions. However, the fact that association with oxytocin and OXTR genes are found indicates that the oxytocin system is indeed involved in ADS. Epigenetic causes could also be related to ASD, as regions regulating expression of OXTR were found to be hypermethylated, showing again the importance of oxytocin related genes in the pathophysiology of ASD.</p>

	<h5><b>Schizophrenia</b></h5>

	<p style="text-align:justify;">
	Data on whether or not plasma or CSF oxytocin levels are associated with schizophrenia are conflicting. Some studies indicate that lower plasma levels and higher CSF levels correlate with more psychotic symptoms, whereas others indicate no difference between patients and healthy controls. For the genetic causes, early studies have found that different OXT and OXTR variants were associated with schizophrenia, while more recent studies didn’t find any association. In addition, some of these association studies were not significant after correction for multiple testing. Taken together, these studies present less evidence for a role of the oxytocin system in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia than for ASD and more research needs to be done in this field.</p>

	<h3>Histology</h3>

	<p style="text-align:justify;">
	Oxytocin is released by the axon terminals of the neurohypophysis in so-called Herring bodies. On electron microscopy images, these are dilated areas in the terminal portion of axons with clusters of neurosecretory granules (containing oxytocin, antidiuretic hormone and neurophysins). Herring bodies often lie close to capillaries, which can be seen on the following image showing the axon terminals of the neurohypophysis.</p>

    Genetic regulation: alterations of genes involved in oxytocinergic signaling could be associated with differences in socio behavioral phenotypes.
